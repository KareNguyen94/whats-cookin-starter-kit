# Dash of delish

Welcome to Dash of delish! This is your new go-to app when it comes to deciding what to cook for dinner! On page load, a random user is generated, along with all of the current items in their pantry. A handful of pre-loaded recipes are displayed on the home page, which is where a user can search, filter, favorite, and add meals to their 'cook next' section. Once a user decides which meal they desire to cook, the website will automatically check their pantry items to see if they have the correct amount of ingredients or not. If they do, instructions on how to cook their meal will be displayed. If the user is missing ingredients, a list of those ingredients will be displayed, along with the cost for all of the items they are missing.
